      <p> I have had the privilege of working in different types of organization ranging from Startups to Think Tank, and have had several corporate experiences. Through these opporunities, I have acquired various skills from data analytics to marketing. I have also been involved in Technology startups in the past through which I realized that it was a big handicap for me as a business founder not to know technical skills. This pushed me to learn Front-end Web Development which I am still trying to excel in my free time. I plan to learn Ruby on Rails this coming year to acquire knowledge on Back-end Web Development.

    <h2>PORTFOLIO/IDEAS</h2>
    <h3 style="text-decoration:underline" class="rasteh">RASTE</h3>
    <h5 class="rasteh">Platform that connects talented Pakistani Artisans with the global community</h5>

    <div class="col-md-6 ">
      <img src="images/raste4.png" height="300" width="400" id="rasteimg">
    </div>

    <p  class="rasteh1">Designed this platform at an event called Pakathon, a hackathon in Toronto with the theme of finding technological solutions to the social problems in Pakistan. I worked with a talented team with various skills ranging from Business to Web Development. The idea behind Raste was basically to bring the products of a common artisan in Pakistan to the global community. We also wanted to portray their struggles and stories behind each of their products.</p>

    <h3 class="hashawaaz">HashAwaaz</h3>
    <h5 class="choon">Idea about a very simple interface for those who cannot read or write. Right now people who are educated can easily voice their opinions through social media but what about the portion of the world who cannot?</h5>

  
   <div>
      <img src="images/madad1.png" height="300" width="300" id="rasteimg">

      <p class="choon1"> The cost of smartphones in developing countries like Pakistan has been rapidly decreasing. This has opened opportunities for new interface interactions. This is a concept of a simple visual interface for the illiterate with icons representing services to problems they encounter frequently like Crime.
      </p>

   <div class="choonspc">
      <img src="images/madad2.png" height="300" width="300" id="rasteimg">

      <p class="choon1"> Upon choosing one of the categories, they will then be given three options. Explaining this through an example, lets say there is a lot of garbage accumulating in an area in Rural Pakistan which is causing health risks. Resident there can communicate with the authorities by taking a picture and recording a message through which they can explain the situation. The hashtag feature is meant to be one word recordings describing/categorizing their situation.Words spoken once have more clarity than full sentences which will help us translate them in text form and then map them out easily to visualize general problems in various areas.

      <img src="images/Hash4.png" height="300" width="400" id="rasteimg">
    </div>

    <p class="choonspc4"> Above is a quick mockup of a web dasboard which authorities can have access which will give a feed of user submissions. The spoken words in the hashtag sections can then be translated into text mapped out according to location which will be captured by the App. The same way pictures can then be displayed in Pinterest style to show what is happening around regions.</p>

     <h3 class="hashawaaz">INSAAF</h3>
    <h5 class="choon">Platform that tracks human right violations</h5>

   
    <div class="col-md-6">

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <img src="images/Insaaf4.png" height="300" width="400" id="rasteimg">
    </div>

    <p class="choonspc4"> Idea about a Human Rights violation platform called Insaaf which in urdu means Justice. Numerous human rights violation occur in Pakistan, some of which are picked up by Media for example the infamous Shahzeb killing case in Karachi, Pakistan (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Shahzeb_Khan">Shahzeb Case</a>). But eventually in such cases the families of victims are pressurized into pardoning the perpetrators. After sometime the story becomes old and people forget about it, and then the same crime is commited again by someone else who thinks that they can beat the system. The way the platform will work is that users will create a submission of a human rights violation which can then be tracked by others. Every violation will have its own profile with description and timeline. Users will be able to comments on the current status of what is happening and they can also come together to create actions assigned to volunteering users for solving these problems and demand justice.</p>

          <h3 class="hashawaaz">Taleem</h3>
    <h5 class="choon">Idea of a way to educate the illiterate through images which they can understand and then relate to text words</h5>

  
   <div>
      <img src="images/taleem1.png" height="300" width="300" id="rasteimg">

      <p class="choon1">Images are provided with a letter on top indicating start of the word. As many can understand what images means therefore it could serve as a reference point to learning letters and words.

  </div>


   <div class="choonspc">
      <img src="images/tal2.png" height="300" width="300" id="rasteimg">

      <p class="choon1">Once an image is clicked, it then displays the word and also a voice recording of the pronounciation of the word which can then be picked up by the person.
